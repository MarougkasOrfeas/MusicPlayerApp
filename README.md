## Usage

* Once permission is granted, the app will load the list of music tracks available on the device. NOTE: Permission for notifications must be set in order for notification to work
* Tap on a track to start playback. Use the playback controls to manage playback.
* You can also control playback from the notification bar while the app is minimized.
